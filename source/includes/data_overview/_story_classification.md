##Story Classification

THOUSANDS of sources/authors post about the SAME news stories resulting in MILLIONS of articles/day. 

Accern groups together articles talking about similar information (i.e. certain equities A, B, & C are involved in some financial event D) into **UNIQUE STORIES**.
Accern is the pioneer of this story classification process, allowing you to track how information flows online. 

* You will know the current [exposure](#saturation-story_saturation) of a financial news headline
* You will know the [overall sentiment](#sentiment-story_sentiment) of this market event
* You will know if the source that just posted a rumor is reliable based on authenticity of previous rumor-related stories published
* Many more [analytics](#accern-analytics)

**In Depth:** Story classification model is agnostic of article sentiment and it only groups based on the **extracted entities and events.**
Semantic structure of the article is taken as input. The model identifies important themes and checks in the **last 2 weeks** for similar themes.
If similar theme was found, it groups along with this theme.
A combination of machine learning models used to extract entities and then linked back amongst the 8k+ U.S equities and 1k+ financial events.

Accern has compiled multiple entity dictionaries for linking names mentioned in media to the correct entities.

**Proprietary Entities Dictionary**
Accern has developed a proprietary dictionary that maps all ways financial entities are mentioned in the media to the 8,000-plus U.S. public equities.

The dictionary consists of over 150,000 company name variations and includes Bloomberg IDs, ticker symbols, etc. mapped back to these company names.
**How? -** Looking at historical data, we identify the different ways companies have been mentioned to build and update this dictionary.

**Proprietary Financial Events Dictionary**
Accern has developed a proprietary dictionary that maps over 30,000 financial event variations mentioned in media to an aggregated list of 1,000-plus financial events. 
**How? -** We worked with financial analysts/equity researchers to figure out an initial list of important financial events. 
Then, starting with this list and looking at historical data, we figured out different variations of event names.
