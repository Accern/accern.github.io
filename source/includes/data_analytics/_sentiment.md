##Sentiment (article_sentiment)
**What is it?** Sentiment score (-1 - +1) of the article based on title and content.

**Quick Definition:** determines if the article was written positively or negatively by the author/editor.

**How is it created?** Sentiment Analysis of articles involves 3 parallel models. **(bag of words + n-grams + deep-learning)**

* Bag of Words involves a proprietary list of 300,000-plus positive and negative words, differently weighed, which are used to gauge a base sentiment of an article.

* N-grams involves a proprietary list of positive and negative two- to three-word phrases which are used to gauge a more accurate sentiment in articles. 
These lists are compiled by financial analysts.

* Next, a Deep Learning model predicts how much the article is positive or negative based on the vector representation of its text. 

* Finally, a meta model (ensemble learning) uses the output of all these 3 models to generate a final score.

* **Tesco workers shouldnâ€™t lose Family Income Supplement** - "This would be a completely unfair and mean spirited move.
