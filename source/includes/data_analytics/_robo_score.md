**Quick Definition:** A shocking amount of financial news is created not by humans, but by computer algorithms. Robot score presents the percentage of robo news coming from a source. An article from a source with high robo score may not likely to move the market.

**How is it created?** Based on text data clustering model, we generated an overall robo score for

3-Step Process for Computing Robo Score:

1. A story clustering model looks into historical data (metadata of unique stories), how similar stories share in structure and content.

2. Human curation upon the clusters will downgrade the robo score if the the content is from companies or government department's official website.

3. A Source Robo score is generated by the percentage of clustered articles.

**Examples**

- **Robo News Cluster**

-- *Costco Q2 Net Falls 15.4 Percent*

-- *Amazon Q1 Net Jumps 31.7 Percent*

The two articles share the information of earnings call for Costco and Amazon. Robo News cluster grabs the story and based on the NLP metric we use, these article are identified as similar.

- **Not Robo News Cluster (WithHuman Curation)**

-- *Federal Reserve Board announces termination of enforcement action with Boscobel Bancorp and Community First Bank*

-- *Federal Reserve Board announces termination of enforcement action with Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc.*

**Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System** announces termination of enforcement action in a similar form of title and content. Similar cases share with company official earning report, SEC filings, etc. Human curation will lower the score for these specific clusters.
